# FLAGS software interview task

## Software requirements
- node (v14 LTS)
- yarn

## Getting started
- run `yarn install` to install dependencies
- run `yarn start` to run the web app

At this point, your browser should have opened, and you should see the task requirements. These are also available in [requirements.pdf](requirements.pdf).

## Expectations
Once the software requirements are set up, this should take no longer than an hour to do the very basic hard requirements. We would expect you to not spend more than around 4 hours on this in total - by then there should be plenty for us to discuss.

Included is a [document](candidate-notes.md) that you can use for taking notes for discussion after you have completed the task. This is for you alone, and is not intended to be included in the repository (in fact it is ignored in `.gitignore`, so assuming you do not change its name or location, you should not have to think about this). Feel free to add as much or as little into this as you want, including notes on features you may think would be appropriate to be added at a later date that we have not explicitly specified.
